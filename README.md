## Setup

### Environment Setup

Make sure you have the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/) installed.

Because we are using pre-built and a custom development client, you should download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) to your Mac. For more information on setting up your development environment, refer to the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) for Android Studio and the [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=native) for Xcode.

### App Setup
To build the app, perform the following steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npx expo prebuild`
4. Run `npx expo run:ios` or `npx expo run:android`
